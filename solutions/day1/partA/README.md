# Day 1 Part A - Solution

Simply run the script and view the terminal's output to view the answer. However, make sure that 
`FILE_MODE_REAL_INPUT_MODE` is set to true if you want to run the script against the problem input data the AOC challenge 
expects you to solve. Setting it to false will run the script against the contents of `test.txt` which is a 
test case presented in the problem itself. 

## Problem Difficulty (1-10)

3.5/10

## Solution Explanation

The main point of potential difficulty in this problem relies on parsing the text file and being 
familiar with the input/output libraries of your programming language of use. 

This problem basically requires you to choose a suitable data structure like an array or dictionary, in this case,
that is able to track the total calories that each elf is carrying with them.

One thing that we need to be cautious of is that we know we are done counting calories for an elf once we reach a newline
`\n` character. 

## Answer

The answer for this problem is **68467** given my specialized input data noting that every AOC user will not receive the
same input data even for the same problem.
