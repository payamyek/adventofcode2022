# Advent of Code 2022

This holiday season I have decided that for the first time to partake in the 2022 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 
(AOC) challenge. The AOC challenge presents two sets of problems everyday leading up to Christmas day. In light of the 
Christmas spirit, I will be documenting all my solutions and providing detail and precise annotations to allow potential 
readers to improve in future AOC challenges.


# My Progress

| Day                                      | Part 1       | Part 2      |
|------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| [1](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1) | ⭐ | ⭐ |
| [2](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2) | ⭐ | ⭐|
| [3](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3) | ⭐ | ⭐|

# Format of Solutions

The solutions posted will be more polished than their initial state used to complete the AOC challenges. 

This repository will be structured in the following way, for every day of the challenges there will be a folder named 
`dayi`, where `i` is an integer detailing the day of the challenge. With two sub folders `dayi/partA` and `dayi/partB` 
each containing four files: `input.txt`, `test.txt`,`solution.py` and `README.MD`.

- `input.txt` is the text file containing the input file of the problem set
- `test.txt` is the text file containing a test case of the problem set
- `solution.py` is the python file containing the solution
- `README.md` provides further insight into how the solution works and the nature of the solution and problem


# Caveat

Note that each problem has a input file that is feed into the script but this input data is not the same for all users
and thus make sure to use your own input file to run against the script to get accurate results for your tailored problem.
i.e the `input.txt` might differ from person to person, so make sure to use your own data set to calculate the answer
properly for your inputs.
